# Extensible RAG Agent with Vertex AI Search

This repository provides a starting point for a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system built on Google Cloud. It uses the Google Agent Development Kit (ADK) to create a conversational agent that can reason over unstructured data, like PDFs, indexed in Vertex AI Search.

The codebase is intended as a functional example that can be extended. It currently handles PDF ingestion and provides a basic chat interface, with `TODO` markers and challenges included to guide developers in enhancing its capabilities.
